                    <h4>New materials appearing daily</h4>
                    <p>We will experiment to achieve results needed with materials. Some development projects done include pattern-plating on  3-dimentinal surfaces, thickness down to 10 microns, huge multi-dielectrics very heavy copper .062 inner and one inch thick boards. We are asked to make special light weight air dielectric boards or special caviety pressing process with sequential lamination using active and passive components. Materials including RF, LowLoss, DK, HighSpeed, Foam, Teflon, Kapton, Pyrex & BoraSilca Glass, Thin Film, LCP to name a few.</p>
