                    <h4>About Brigitflex</h4>
                    <p>What makes us different from 'EveryOtherPCBShop' is our understanding - our BELIEF - that we are NOT JUST SELLING YOU A 'PRODUCT'! When you place an order with us, we become participants in the outcome of your design, packaging, and manufacturing efforts! </p>
                    <p>We deeply value good customer relationships we have built over many years of working in this industry. You are increasingly under tremendous pressure to deliver results, and we are always willing to apply our full effort, and the materials expertise of our suppliers, to help you meet your design and manufacturing requirements. As in any good partnership, we believe in being honest and objective with you about any difficulties or problems when they may arise. We do this because, in our uncommonly diverse experience, it is proven repeatedly that this is the most effective way to successfully meet your needs, and so too, the needs of your customers. </p>
                    <p>At the 'nuts-and-bolts' level, our commitment is especially evident in the customized adaptation of equipment and processes to deliver cost-effective circuits, from engineering-intensive concepts/prototypes into repeatable production. <a href="../contact/">Contact us</a> with any questions or requests. We look forward to the opportunity to make a difference - for YOU!</p>

                    <h4>Why Choose Us</h4>
                    <p>When you work with Brigitflex you get 40 years of hands-on experience. Beyond out total in-house manufacturing capability, we have cultivated uniquely strong relationships with our suppliers and partners such as Rogers, Taconic, Arlon, Nelco, DuPont, Sheldahl, Ticer and Ohmega to name a few.</p>
                    <p>We pride ourselves on our proven ability to take a design from the 'concept' level and build to meet your requirements. We achieve this by making our business understand your needs and applying our manufacturing expertise to deliver successful results. If necessary we can help you experiment to develop new materials, new manufacturing methods or build specialized equipment. We manufacture in the United States and always strive to meet your needs in a timely manner.</p>
